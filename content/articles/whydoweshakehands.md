The handshake is one of the most universal gestures in Western culture, but have you ever stopped to wonder where it came from?

## Ancient Origins

The handshake dates back to at least the 5th century BC in ancient Greece. It appears in artwork showing soldiers grasping each other's hands as a gesture of peace — proving they weren't carrying weapons.

## Why the Right Hand?

Traditionally, warriors carried swords in their right hand. Extending it openly showed trust and peaceful intent. This is also likely why we consider it rude to shake with the left hand in many cultures.

## The Modern Handshake

Today, the handshake has evolved far beyond its origins as a peace gesture. It seals business deals, greets strangers, and even determines first impressions. Studies suggest that a firm handshake can positively influence how others perceive you.
