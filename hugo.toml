baseURL = "https://bitsandwonder.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Bits and Wonder"
theme = "PaperMod"

[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod"
```

And **delete** the `theme = "PaperMod"` line since the module import replaces it.

**Step 3: Commit and push through GitHub Desktop**

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You should see the changes listed
3. Commit with message "Switch to Hugo modules for theme"
4. Click Push

**Step 4: Later, when we set up Cloudflare Pages**

We'll set the build command to:
```
hugo mod get && hugo


[params]
  description = "Exploring the stories behind everyday life"
  ShowReadingTime = true
  ShowShareButtons = false
  ShowPostNavLinks = true
  ShowBreadCrumbs = true
  defaultTheme = "light"

  [params.homeInfoParams]
    Title = "Welcome to Bits and Wonder"
    Content = "Exploring the fascinating stories behind the things we do, say, and wonder about every day."

[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS"]

[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Articles"
    url = "/articles/"
    weight = 10
  [[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url = "/about/"
    weight = 20

[taxonomies]
  category = "categories"
  tag = "tags"
```

**Step 9: Create Your First Article**
```
hugo new content/articles/why-do-we-shake-hands.md
